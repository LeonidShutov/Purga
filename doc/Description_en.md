No ads, free forever, no subscription needed. Open source.
Purga is the app for you if you like nature sounds and want to relax.
Are you tired of looking for some long nature sounds video on your favorite video hosting every night you are putting you kid to bed?
Are you tired it is interrupted constantly with the ads? 
Are you tired it stops playing if you switch the app or lock the screen and demands premium version for such features?
Purga is the answer.

Choose any included sounds you like. turn on multiple nature sounds at the same time. Set volume level individually for each sound.
Use sleep timer, so it will not play all night long if you fell asleep. 

Why app is named Purga? It's blizzard in Russian. And we like how it sounds.
